# Unwinding Buddy
 
**Unwinding Buddy** is a lightweight PowerShell utility that helps you follow the [20-20-20 rule](https://wiki.endmyopia.org/wiki/20-20-20_rule) â€” encouraging you to take a break every 20 minutes to rest your eyes and mind.
 
## Features
 
- Displays a colorful popup window after 20 minutes of screen time
- Friendly and visually engaging message
- Auto-dismiss or manual confirmation via "Got It!" button
- Optionally pauses for a short break (e.g., 20 seconds) before restarting
- Built with native PowerShell and Windows Forms
 
## How it Works
 
The script uses a countdown timer (default: 20 minutes) and displays a popup when the timer ends. Once you click "Got It!", the script pauses for a short break (default: 20 seconds) and starts a new session.
 
## Installation
 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atulk93/Unwinding-Buddy.git
